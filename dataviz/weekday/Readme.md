# Weekday analysis

Here are a few charts about the occurence' differneces between workday and weekend for a given technologies.
People asking questions about development during the weekend might be :
- students : it is not a surprise, students work even the weekend whjen needed
- freelances : some freelance developers are not bound to office hours, and are more linkely to work on weekend
- amateurs : many people are passionated about technlogy, and like to spend time on side-projects

I think the most important category is the third one : most of questions asked during the weekend comes from amateurs. We can imagine people working on their free time would choose the technologies they will use according to their skills, but also regarding the "hype" of the this technology.
In the following charts, we will observe the differences for given technologies between worked days, and weekend days.
A great differences could imply : 
- the job market maturity for this technology : if many people ask about this techno during office hours, they are problably using it at work
- a hated technology : as developers can choose wich technologies to use for their side projects, they would not choose inneficient or unnecessarily complicated tools.

From theses results, we can measure the relative difference between the amount of question asked in office days and weekend days. Theses scores can be then ploted to show among the most popular technologies, which ones are also used by developpers on their free time, as a hobby.
